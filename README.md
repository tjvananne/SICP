I'm currently working through the **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** book. This has been on my list of fundamental programming books I've been wanting to work through for a very long time, so that's how I'll be spending some of my free quarantine time.

The goals that are driving me to work through this book:

* become a better programmer in general
* gain more knowledge of programming language design
* learn more about the (pure) functional programming paradigm
* I've heard scheme (and many other lisp dialects) are really fun to use
	- I might be interested in eventually creating some domain-specific languages where I would most likely be using a dialect of lisp 


I think it is critically important to know the basic fundamental history of "how we got to now" in terms of programming / computation. This book was originally released in 1979, but I think the conceps and themes throughout the book are still incredibly relevant (and hard to come by in more modern programming books).
